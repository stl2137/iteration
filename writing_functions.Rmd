library(tidyverse)
library(rvest)
```

## Let's start

we're going to write some function

Z-scores
```{r}
x = rnorm(n = 30, mean = 4, sd = 2.3)
x_again = rnorm(n = 30, mean = 6, sd = 0.3)

(x - mean(x))/sd(x)
(x_again - mean(x_again)) / sd(x_again)
```

Here's the function
```{r}
z_score <- function(x) {
  
  (x - mean(x)) / sd(x)
}
```

Try out the function
```{r}
z_score(x = x_again)
```
